        "feedback": "Good attempt! You mentioned 'small matter', which relates to Democritus' idea. However, it's important to specify that he proposed that matter is made up of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms. Keep it up!",
        "model_answer": "Democritus had the creative idea that matter is made up of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms, which means 'uncuttable' in Greek.",
        "why": "Democritus was a philosopher who lived around 400 BC. He suggested that if you keep dividing matter into smaller and smaller pieces, you would eventually reach a point where you couldn't divide it anymore. He called these smallest pieces 'atoms', which means 'indivisible'. This idea was revolutionary because it introduced the concept that everything around us is made up of tiny building blocks, even though he didn't have the scientific tools we have today to prove it.",

When these particles were directed at a very thin sheet of gold foil, most passed through, but some were deflected at large angles. This led to the discovery that atoms have a small, dense nucleus at their center, surrounded by empty space where electrons are found.",
