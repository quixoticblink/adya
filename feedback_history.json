      "model_answer": "Democritus had the creative idea that all matter is made up of tiny, indivisible particles called 'atoms,' which means 'uncuttable' in Greek.",
      "why": "Democritus was a philosopher who lived a long time ago, around 400 BC. He suggested that if you keep dividing matter into smaller and smaller pieces, you would eventually reach a point where you cannot divide it anymore. He called these tiny pieces 'atoms.' This was a groundbreaking idea because, at that time, most people thought matter could be divided indefinitely. Understanding that atoms are the building blocks of matter is fundamental in chemistry.",

He directed these particles at a very thin sheet of gold foil. The purpose was to see how these particles would interact with the atoms in the gold. Most of the particles passed through, but some were deflected at large angles, leading to the discovery that atoms have a small, dense nucleus at their center. This was a key moment in understanding atomic structure.",
