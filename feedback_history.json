    "question_prompt": "What creative idea did Democritus have about matter that led to the idea of atoms?",

      "verdict": "Partly correct",
      "score_band": "0-1",
      "feedback": "Good attempt! You mentioned 'small atoms,' which is related to Democritus's ideas. However, it's important to explain that he proposed that all matter is made up of tiny, indivisible particles called 'atoms.' Keep working on providing more detail in your answers!",
      "model_answer": "Democritus had the creative idea that all matter is made up of tiny, indivisible particles called 'atoms,' which means 'uncuttable' in Greek.",
      "why": "Democritus was a philosopher who lived a long time ago, around 400 BC. He suggested that if you keep dividing matter into smaller and smaller pieces, you would eventually reach a point where you cannot divide it anymore. He called these tiny pieces 'atoms.' This was a groundbreaking idea because, at that time, most people thought matter could be divided indefinitely. Understanding that atoms are the building blocks of matter is fundamental in chemistry.",

        "Atoms are not just small; they are specific particles that make up all matter.",

      "verdict": "Incorrect",
      "score_band": "0",
      "feedback": "It's okay not to know the answer right now! Rutherford's experiment is an important part of atomic theory. Let's work together to understand it better.",
      "model_answer": "In Rutherford’s experiment, he fired alpha particles at a thin sheet of gold foil.",
      "why": "In Rutherford's experiment, he used alpha particles, which are positively charged particles emitted from radioactive materials. When these alpha particles were directed at a thin sheet of gold foil, most passed through, but some were deflected at angles. This led Rutherford to conclude that atoms have a small, dense nucleus at their center, surrounded by mostly empty space. Understanding this helps us learn how atoms are structured.",
